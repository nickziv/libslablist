ILLUMOS:

To install:

	cd build/illumos
	make all
	make install

To uninstall

	cd build/illumos
	make uninstall

The install won't work, if you don't have the Primary Administrator role on
Illumos (makefiles use pfexec a lot).  If you don't have this role, you will
need to change the PREFIX variable in build/Makefile.master.

LINUX: 

WARNING, the code for linux is very alpha and may have problems. It hasn't be
tested sufficiently for me to recommend its usage for anything other than
development and debugging. This area could use some love.

To install:

	cd build/linux
	make all
	make install

To uninstall

	cd build/linux
	make uninstall

The install won't work, if you don't have sudo access. If you don't have this
access, you will need to change the PREFIX variable in build/Makefile.master.
