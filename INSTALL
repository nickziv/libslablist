To install:

	cd build/illumos
	make install

To uninstall

	cd build/illumos
	make uninstall

The install won't work, if you don't have the Primary Administrator role on
Illumos (makefiles use pfexec a lot).  If you don't have this role, you will
need to change the PREFIX variable in build/Makefile.master.
