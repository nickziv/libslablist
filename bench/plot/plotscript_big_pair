# Next, we plot our sorted structures at significantly larger input sizes. We
# no longer need the logarithmic scale, as we have dropped linked lists from
# the plots. All of these structs are on the same plot.

# gnuplot no longer support pbm :(
# so we'll write to png instead
#set terminal netpbm small size 640,480
set terminal png nocrop small size 640,480
set output outputfile
set format x "%10.1e"
plot inputfile1 using 1:2 notitle ,\
inputfile2 using 1:2 notitle
