Most of the plots are generated as PBM images, and are then converted to EPS
and JPEG via the commandline (using tools from the netpbm library). Gnuplot
_can_ output to EPS directly, but that can result in images that take much
longer to load.

The EPS files are neccessary for inclusion into TeX-generated PDF documents.
The JPEG files are neccessary for inclusion into web pages.
