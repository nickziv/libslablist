`libslablist` is an implementation of slab lists.

Slab lists are a memory efficient data structure, that can optionally keep data
sorted in logarithmic time.

See the block comment at the top of src/slablist_impl.h for implementation
overview.

The `libslablist` API is not yet stable. It is volatile and may change.

All of the code in the library follows the Illumos kernel coding style,
sometimes referred to as BJNF (Bill Joy Normal Form).

To install go to /build, and run ./build_install_all. This only works for
Illumos and only if you have gcc. Sun Studio is no longer supported.
